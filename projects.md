There are several projects that may be interesting:

### [Caches](https://github.com/vpetrigo/caches)

Header only cache library. Several cache policies provided:
- LRU cache policy
- LFU cache policy
- FIFO cache policy

Other cache replacement policies can be implemented and I will be glad to accept PRs.

### [ARM CMake Toolchains](https://github.com/vpetrigo/arm-cmake-toolchains)

Set of CMake helper files that ease usage of cross-compilation toolchains (GCC based or Clang based)
for ARM MCU projects. Initially that repo was designed to work with ARM Cortex-M families like
nRF52, STM32, NXP K64, etc., but that CMake toolchain files may be easily adopted for other toolchains.

### [sntpc](https://github.com/vpetrigo/sntpc)

Rust SNTP client that can send requests to NTP servers and process responses
